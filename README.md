# Hospital Readmission Prediction System

## Problem Statement
Predict which diabetic patients will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge to help hospitals intervene early and reduce Medicare penalties.

## Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository - Diabetes 130-US Hospitals (1999-2008)
- **Size:** 101,766 encounters from 71,518 patients
- **Target:** 11.16% readmitted within 30 days (class imbalance challenge)

## Key Findings So Far
- 30,248 patients had multiple hospital visits (29.7%)
- Elderly patients (70-80) have 6.5x higher readmission rate than children
- Major missing data: weight (96.8%), glucose serum (94.7%), A1C results (83.3%)
